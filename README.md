- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Nazar
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend engineering
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software development with Python, CL/CI, algorithms, Django framework, Flask micro framework, Linux OS and many other things :)
- âœ¨ You can check out projects I've already developed and some of problems I've solved (problems and other educational exercises located in "Scratches" repo, obviously the repo doesn't contain all of the problems I've solved during my learning path and tbh repo isn't that good yet so don't check it xD)
